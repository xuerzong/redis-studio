## 🚀 Get Started

### Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before installation, you need to install [Node.js 18+](https://https://nodejs.org/).

You can install the Redis Studio command-line tool globally via npm (Node Package Manager).

```bash
npm -g @xuerzong/redis-studio
```

### Start Server

> [!NOTE]
> Redis Studio runs as a standalone application, and its server provides the web interface. You still require a running Redis instance to connect to and manage your data.

After installation, use the `rds` command to manage the background service for Redis Studio.

- Check Version

```bash
rds --version # OR `rds -V`
```

- Start Service

```bash
rds start
```

- Stop Service

```bash
rds stop
```

- Restart Service

```bash
rds restart
```

## 🔨 Configuration

### Default Settgins

By default, the Redis Studio service runs on port `5090` on localhost.

### Custom Port

You can specify a different port using a command-line flag when starting the service:

```bash
rds start --port 9000
```

## 💻 How To Dev

```bash
cd ./redis-studio

npm install

npm run start
```
